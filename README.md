Blockchain and Crypto Enthusiast.
Cryptocurrency fundamental/technical analyst. 
Profound understanding of DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. 

Social Media Manager (certified) | Helping companies, either start-ups or established manage and grow their social media platforms to drive more sales/adoption.


Summary
A creative, resourceful and detail oriented individual with an eye for knowledge and success. I have worked as both a content creator and social media manager. Educating people, for me, is the best thing anyone can do. This is strongly backed with a notable quote by the great thinker and philosopher Socrates, who is credited as the founder of Western philosophy, which is "There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance".
I take much pleasure and fulfillment in helping people with genuine information. What drives me to do this is nothing but the passion, i focus on putting out quality contents to educate people in the most attractive and simplest way possible. I'm glad i can do this even as a profession to help companies/businesses grow.
